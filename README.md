5. Instructions are added from `classes/add_instructions.py`


## How does it work

1. You create your config file
      `optimizo.py -c`   OR  `optimizo.py -c -w .`

    It will generate something like this:
    
```
{
    "develop": [{
        "name": "copy",
        "src": "C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\projects\\Optimizo\\config.py",
        "dst": "C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\projects\\Optimizo\\classes"
    }, {
        "name": "replace",
        "src": "C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\projects\\Optimizo\\config.py",
        "search": "excluded_folders",
        "replace": "excluded_beans"
}]}
```

2. You then add your instructions like this

    #### Method 1: Interactive
     `optimizo.py -g develop -a`


    #### Method 2: Semi-Interactive
    `optimizo.py -g develop -i move`



     It will ask you for instruction name and extra details.
     You can also add multiple instructions like these

     **Note:** Develop here is a group name in your config, it can be `cats, chickens, deploy, hide, etc`

     **Note:*** If a group is not available it is added

3. Run your group of instruction
    `optimizo.py -r develop`
    
**Note:** If you know what you are doing you can manually modify `optimizo.json`
**Note:** Instructions are run one after the other.
